      <p>Bellingham Wa.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Love biking, skiing, hiking around, basically anything outdoors</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>The dream job is carving a little niche out for myself. Nothing big, just a little SAS to scrape some cash. Although Health insurrance and benifits are cool, so working as a developer for a company like Mapbox or Critigen would be killer too :)</p>

      <p>Bellingham lolz</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I love solving problems and building things, for years I have solved problems as an analyst. Now I want to build those tools and solve bigger problems</p>
